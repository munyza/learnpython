# Loops

## Explanation 
- There are 2 different types of loops, for loops and while loops. 
- *For* loops are used for when knowing how many times you want to loops (or when looping over a sequence such as strings, list or range).
- *While* loops are when you dont know how many times the loop should run, keeps running as long as condition is true. 

### for loop: count from 1 to 5
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```
### while loop: count from 1 to 5
```python
x = 1
while x <= 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```
